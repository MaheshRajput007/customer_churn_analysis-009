## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical business challenge ‚Äî losing customers directly impacts revenue and growth. In this project, we aim to:

> **Identify customers at high risk of churning** using historical behavioral and demographic data, so the business can proactively engage them with retention strategies ‚Äî before they leave.

Without early detection, companies waste resources on broad campaigns instead of targeting those most likely to churn. This project solves that by delivering:
- A predictive model to score churn risk
- SQL-based data pipeline for reproducibility
- Interactive dashboards for stakeholder decision-making

## üîç Key Findings

‚úÖ **Top Churn Drivers** (from model & dashboard):
- Customers with **low engagement** (e.g., < 2 logins/month) are 3.5x more likely to churn
- **High-value customers** on monthly plans churn more than those on annual plans
- **Support ticket volume** correlates strongly with churn ‚Äî especially unresolved tickets

‚úÖ **Model Performance**:
- Accuracy: **87%**
- Precision (for ‚ÄúChurn‚Äù class): **82%**
- Recall: **79%** ‚Üí meaning we catch ~8 out of 10 at-risk customers

‚úÖ **Business Impact**:
- Targeted retention campaign could reduce churn by **~22%**
- Focus on top 15% high-risk customers captures 68% of total churn cases
